### Instructions for maintaining this repo
- Maintain this `AGENTS.md` file with design decisions, future tasks, feature roadmaps, etc.
- Make sure to divide tasks into managable sizes.
- Make sure to add tests for new features.
- Keep the Current Tasks list below updated when tasks are completed.
- If all tasks have been completed suggest some to the user and update the list with their decisions.

### Future Considerations
- An initial MVP will be created running entirely locally, but eventually a migration into aws will occur.
  - Design decisions should take this into account

### Current Tasks
- All current tasks have been completed!

### Suggested Next Tasks
- Implement user authentication (signup, login, logout)
- Define initial data models for face analysis metrics
- Create basic UI templates and static asset pipeline
- Set up CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) for tests and linting
